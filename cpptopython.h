// Hi, I'm Mohamed Ashraf Fahim and I'm trying now with my friends to help you to decrease your efforts and time in cpp programming process
// This library is developed to translate the c++ syntax into python syntax and if it's not covering 100% of the functions
// it covers about 85~90 % of them and it also defines some other funtions to an easy way instead
// Anyone can help in developing it just contact me via instagram if you want to help and be a member in the developing team : "https://www.instagram.com/mohamedashraffahim/"
